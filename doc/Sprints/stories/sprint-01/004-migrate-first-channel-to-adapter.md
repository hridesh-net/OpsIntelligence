# STORY-004 — Migrate first channel behind adapter (e.g. Telegram)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Sprint** | sprint-01 |
| **Type** | Feature / Refactor |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Estimate** | L |

## Summary

Migrate **one** production channel (recommended: **Telegram**) to implement the new adapter interface and use the shared outbound reliability layer (STORY-002). Prove no user-visible regressions for existing users.

## User story

**As a** Telegram user of OpsIntelligence**  
**I want** the same behavior as before**  
**So that** the refactor does not break my workflows.

## Scope

### In scope

- Telegram bot path uses adapter interface end-to-end.
- Wire retries/DLQ for outbound Telegram sends.
- Feature parity with pre-migration behavior for: text, attachments supported today, commands if any.

### Out of scope

- Migrating WhatsApp/Discord/Slack in this sprint (optional stretch if time-boxed).

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Functional parity**: manual test checklist executed (send, receive, reply, attachment if supported, error handling).
2. **Automated tests**: existing Telegram tests updated; new tests for adapter + retry path using mocks.
3. **No regressions**: existing integration tests pass; CI green.
4. **Config migration**: if any config keys change, provide migration note + backward compatibility or one-time warning.
5. **Rollback plan** documented in PR: how to revert if issues arise in release.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code reviewed with channel owner. _(manual PR/reviewer process)_
- [x] CHANGELOG entry under “Refactor” or “Internal”.

## Dependencies

- STORY-001, STORY-002, STORY-003.

## Risks

- Subtle API timing differences; mitigate with staged rollout or feature flag if available.

## Implementation status

- [x] Telegram adapter migration and runtime wiring completed in `internal/channels/telegram/telegram.go` and `cmd/opsintelligence/main.go`.
- [x] Legacy Telegram reply path uses shared reliability wrapper via `WithReliableOutbound`.
- [x] Telegram test coverage includes session parsing, message splitting, and reliable legacy reply path.
- [x] CI baseline added in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for regression detection.
- [x] Rollback guidance documented in `doc/Sprints/story-done/sprint-01-004-migrate-first-channel-to-adapter.md`.
